# GroupChatProgram
The Objective of this project was to learn how TLS works. Created a group chat program in python that encrypts all messages through TLS. It operates under having multiple clients and a single server. The UI utilizes Python's Tkinter tool.   

Special Note: This was created over a weekend at the 2019 Spring Hackathon hosted by SIUE at the T-rex building in St.Louis.
